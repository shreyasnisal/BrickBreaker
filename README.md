# BrickBreaker

This repository contains the basic code for a brick-breaker game created in Java. You can see how this code developed on the YouTube videos in the Object-Oriented Programming series. Refer to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzDBdV-VQG8) to get started with developing your own brick-breaker game.

## Get in Touch

If you do watch the videos, refer to this repository, and develop your own brick-breaker game, let me know. I would love to know that these resources helped you get started with Java graphics and developing your own game!
